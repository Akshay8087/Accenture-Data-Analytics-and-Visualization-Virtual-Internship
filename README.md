# Data Cleaning: 
Executed data cleaning by removing rows with missing values, adjusting data types, and omitting irrelevant columns.
# Data Modeling:
Merged three key datasets (Reaction Types, Reactions, Content) to create a comprehensive dataset that facilitates in-depth analysis.


# Deliverables:

# Cleaned Dataset:
A refined dataset ready for analysis, focusing on the business question of identifying the top content categories by popularity.
# Data Visualization :  
Prepared visual representations using pie charts and bar charts to illustrate the findings effectively.
# Presentation :
